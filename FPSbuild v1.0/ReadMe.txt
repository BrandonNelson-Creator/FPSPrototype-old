FPSPrototype V1.1

First build of my fps game (tech demo)

Added Movement, jump, gravity to "Player", "Player" now has a look function and can climb stairs. 

Made a quick triggered cutscene (man walks into a bar) 

table in game is going to be for future update 

added quick control hints (pop up on "HUD")

added a gun system, you can throw gun but can't pick up. will have to fix, not sure whats going on.
